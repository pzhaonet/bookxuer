These aspects include the kinetic properties of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase; the requirements of the photosynthetic carbon reduction and photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycles for reduced pyridine nucleotides; the dependence of electron transport on photon flux and the presence of a temperature dependent upper limit to electron transport. The measurements of gas exchange with which the model outputs may be compared include those of the temperature and partial pressure of CO2(p(CO2)) dependencies of quantum yield, the variation of compensation point with temperature and partial pressure of O2(p(O2)), the dependence of net CO2 assimilation rate on p(CO2) and irradiance, and the influence of p(CO2) and irradiance on the temperature dependence of assimilation rate.},

	scenarios are expected to strongly affect high-altitude ecosystem
	processes. This study investigates the effect of an exceptionally
	short snow season on the phenology and carbon dioxide source/sink
	strength of a subalpine grassland. An earlier snowmelt of more than
	one month caused a considerable advancement (40 days) of the beginning
	of the carbon uptake period (CUP) and, together with a delayed establishment
	of the snow season in autumn, contributed to a two-month longer CUP.
	The combined effect of the shorter snow season and the extended CUP
	led to an increase of about 100% in annual carbon net uptake. Nevertheless,
	the unusual environmental conditions imposed by the early snowmelt
	led to changes in canopy structure and functioning, with a reduction
	of the carbon sequestration rate during the snow-free period.},

  abstract   = {Micrometeorological measurements were made over an irrigated rice
	paddy during the Huaihe River Basin Experiment ({HUBEX)} in 1999.
	This study addresses the quality control and gap filling strategy
	for the heat fluxes with the Bowen ratio energy balance ({BREB)}
	method. It also endeavors to benefit future studies through comparing
	five methodologies to estimate the net water exchange. First, a three-step
	quality control strategy is constructed. Its first two steps guarantee
	the correct flux directions and reject suspicious data, respectively.
	The third step forbids supersaturation by considering the Bowen ratio
	ranges for different flux combinations (termed as “scenarios�??????.
	The quality-controlled latent heat ({LE)} and sensible heat (H) fluxes
	fall in three scenarios, namely I ({LE} {\textgreater} 0, H {\textgreater}
	0), {II} ({LE} {\textgreater} 0, H {\textless} 0), and {IV} ({LE}
	{\textless} 0, H {\textless} 0). Second, the {Priestley–Taylor} evaporation
	model ({PTEM)} is applied to fill the gaps of {LE}, while the energy
	balance relationship is used to gap-fill H, namely H = R N �??????G
	�??????{LE} (R N : net radiation; G: soil heat flux). Central to
	the success of this strategy is the idea to calibrate the {Priestley–Taylor}
	parameter (α) in a scenario-specific manner. On average, α values
	are calibrated as 1.20 and 1.35 for scenario I and {II}, respectively.
	For scenario {IV}, most α values lie in a narrow range, namely from
	0.9 to 1.0. Then, α is calibrated as 0.97 to extend the applicability
	of the {PTEM} to condensation (negative {LE).} The scenario-specific
	treatment explicitly explains the diurnal variation of α derived
	without distinguishing the scenarios. Third, five methodologies are
	compared in the calculation of net water exchange, including {PTEM-gap-filled}
	{BREB} method (M1), energy-balance-based eddy covariance method (M2),
	and three simplified models to estimate {LE}, respectively as R N
	�??????H, R N �??????G, and R N . A major finding is that G and H
	have a similar effect of about 3\% in the net water exchange. Thus,
	if either is neglected, the net evaporation should be slightly lowered
	to avoid overestimate, by 3\% as a rule of thumb from this work.},

  abstract  = {Potato, being a temperate crop, its growth and tuber production are
	limited by high atmospheric temperatures (mean temperature \&gt;17
	{°C).} As a result potato is grown in winter season only ({November–March)}
	in the eastern plain of India when temperature is favourable. But
	during winter season, rainfall is erratic and meagre, therefore,
	potato crop in the region can only be grown with supplemental irrigation.
	In this study, potato crop was grown with four phenology based irrigation
	treatments (75 mm water depth with each irrigation) with three replications.
	Straw mulch at a rate of 6 t ha�?????? was applied during the first
	earthing up in half of the plots to observe the variation of plant
	growth, water use efficiency and tuber production between mulched
	and non-mulched plots. The experimental split-plot design consisted
	of irrigation treatments in the main plots with mulching and non-mulching
	as subplots. Two years of pooled data with four irrigations resulted
	in air-dry tuber yields of 14.9 and 11.2 t ha�?????? for the mulched
	and non-mulched plots, respectively. Significantly (p \&lt; 0.05)
	higher leaf area index, water use efficiency and intercepted photosynthetically
	active radiation ({IPAR)} were recorded in the mulched plots compared
	to the non-mulched plots under the same irrigation treatment. Higher
	yield and better crop growth were observed in the mulched plots,
	which might be due to conservation of soil moisture and reduction
	of soil temperature by 4�?????? {°C.} The highest {PAR} (89\% of
	the {PAR} incident above the crop canopy) was found near the crop
	with mulching and four irrigations. The 77�??????03 mm less depleted
	soil moisture in the different treatments was due to the application
	of straw mulch. Application of straw mulch significantly increased
	the available phosphorus and potassium in the soil. Water use efficiency
	and tuber productions differed significantly among irrigation treatments
	in the non-mulched plots but they did not in the mulched plots with
	three and four irrigations. Therefore, three irrigations of 75 mm
	each and mulching were recommended for growing potato in the region
	when limited water was available.},

  abstract  = {The present study evaluates firstly the ability of the FAO-56 methodology,
	based on the two-step approach ``reference evapotranspiration (ET0)---crop
	coefficient (K c),'' to accurately determine the actual evapotranspiration
	(ET) of irrigated crops and proposes, secondly, the alternative approaches
	for improving this determination. The FAO-56 methodology is supported
	by two hypotheses: (1) ET0 represents all effects of weather and
	(2) K c varies predominately with specific crop characteristics and
	only marginally with climate, which enables the transfer of K c standard
	values among locations and climates. On the base of the theoretical
	analysis and experimental observations, a critical examination of
	the previous hypotheses demonstrates that they are not verified by
	reality. The first hypothesis is not verified for two reasons: (a)
	The formulation adapted by the Penman--Monteith equation and proposed
	in FAO-56 methodology for calculating ET0 uses climatic variables
	determined at a 24-h average scale. However, in principle it is only
	valid in permanent regime, in other words at least on an hourly scale.
	(b) The FAO-56-proposed formulation attributes a constant value to
	the canopy resistance of the reference surface; but in reality, this
	resistance is variable in relation to the climatic variables. The
	second hypothesis, concerning the two-step approach, is also not
	verified because the values of K c largely vary in relation to climatic
	variables (radiation, air vapour pressure deficit and wind speed).
	This fact does not support the possibility of the transferability
	of K c values into locations where the local conditions deviate from
	the conditions where the adjusted values of K c were determined.
	The weakness of the ET estimation, observed on several crops cultivated
	in the Mediterranean region, through the application of the FAO-56
	methodology, is the result of errors accumulation, associated with
	that affects the determination of either ET0 or K c. The present
	study underlines the advantage of using a one-step approach in the
	calculation of ET, since it is based on fewer computation steps and,
	consequently, on fewer error sources than the two-step model. Two
	models adopting this approach are proposed and validated, one of
	which can be considered as operational, i.e. it only needs standard
	meteorological data as input. The use of these models enables an
	improvement of the ET estimation. This objective is a key component
	of any strategy to improve agricultural water management in Mediterranean

  abstract  = {After more than a century of theoretical development and more recent
	advances in instrumentation, modern observational micrometeorology
	includes a global network of long-term continuous measurement sites
	(FLUXNET). Each site uses eddy covariance methods to monitor terrestrial
	ecosystem-atmosphere exchanges of CO2, water vapor, momentum and
	heat. Currently FLUXNET includes more than 500 sites, covering all
	major plant functional types and climates. However, there is a strong
	spatial bias toward northern hemisphere mid-latitude locations, particularly
	Europe, North America and East Asia. Tropical ecosystems are particularly
	poorly represented, despite playing important roles in carbon and
	water cycles. Synthesis of FLUXNET data shows terrestrial ecosystems
	in general provide a weak sink of atmospheric CO2 at the annual timescale,
	but with large spatial and temporal variability, ranging from strong
	sinks to strong sources. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE)
	that is measured at FLUXNET sites is driven by two much larger opposing
	CO2 exchange processes, ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration,
	which tend to co-vary in strength yet are sensitive to separate environmental
	drivers. Therefore, NEE is not explained well spatially by plant
	functional type or climate regime and is sensitive to inter-annual
	climate variability, especially seasonal rainfall, pests or human
	management approaches. FLUXNET data has been widely used in development
	of remote sensing, surface-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models
	and inversion models. These in general capture seasonal cycles and
	annual budgets quite well, but are weaker at explaining spatial and
	interannual variability and susceptible to inaccuracies in simulated
	inputs such as precipitation. Although research has focused primarily
	on ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling, hydrologic aspects of
	micrometeorology have received considerable attention and several
	studies have investigated the surface energy balance and its lack
	of closure among FLUXNET sites. The contribution of thousands of
	rigorous experimentalists and the collaborative vision of FLUXNET,
	despite its relative youth, has already produced significant advances
	in micrometeorology and ecosystem sciences. Future growth of FLUXNET
	sites in geographically under-represented areas will make a more
	complete understanding of terrestrial ecosystems. Meantime, there
	are many geographic questions ripe for assessment using existing
	FLUXNET datasets which will, in time, build a global compendium of
	terrestrial bio-micrometeorology.},

  abstract  = {Mountain peatlands in the temperate regions represent a small proportion
	of the global peatland resource, but play a unique, although less
	recognized role in the regional water and biogeochemical cycles.
	We conducted leaf and ecosystem {CO2} exchange measurements during
	the growing period of 2008 to investigate the effects of vapor pressure
	deficit ({VPD)} and ground water level ({WL)} on leaf gas exchange
	of two dominant herbaceous species, Molinia caerulea (L.) and Carex
	nigra (L.) in a mountain peatland. Implications of the leaf-level
	responses for net ecosystem {CO2} exchange ({NEE)} were examined.
	Fluctuations in {WL} influenced soil water content ({SWC)} within
	the top 5 cm of the peat profile. Although midday leaf water potential
	during the day (Ψmd) was positively correlated (P {\textless} 0.001)
	with {SWC} in the 5 cm peat profile, there was no direct relationship
	between {WL} and plant water relations parameters. {VPD} and stomatal
	conductance (gs) were negatively correlated at {VPD} {\textgreater}1
	{kPa} regardless of the current {WL} status. Stomatal conductance
	was positively correlated with leaf assimilation (A) and root-shoot
	hydraulic conductance (Ks-l). A decline in {NEE} during summer was
	attributed to stomatal closure due to high {VPD} and low light utilization
	efficiency (α) of the vegetation. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was
	positively correlated with peat temperature at 10 cm depth. Our results
	suggest that increases in {VPD}, as a possible scenario of climate
	change, would lower the photosynthetic capacity of the herbaceous
	peatland vegetation, despite the high {WL}, and hence lower the potential
	of such peatlands as sinks for atmospheric {CO2.}},

	An operational version of a known ETc direct model is described and
	tested. This new version is based on the determination of the weather
	variables collected in a standard agro-meteorological station. The
	original and the operational versions of the ETc model were validated
	on two crops with contrasting height: soybean (0.8聽m) and sweet sorghum
	(3聽m). For soybean, ETc calculated with the two versions gave results
	very similar at both hourly and daily scales. For sweet sorghum,
	ETc calculated with the operational version is good at daily scale
	and not as good, although acceptable, at the hourly scale.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present an operational model to estimate the actual
	evapotranspiration (ET) of crops cultivated on hilly terrains. This
	new model has the following three characteristics: (1) ET modelling
	is based on a Penman--Monteith (PM) type equation (Monteith 1965)
	where canopy resistance is simulated by following an approach already
	illustrated by Katerji and Perrier (Agronomie 3(6):513--521, 1983);
	(2) the estimation of ET, by means of the PM equation, is made by
	using meteorological variables simulated on sloped sites as input;
	(3) these variables are simulated by using simple relationships linking
	the variables measured at a reference site on plane to the topographic
	characteristics of the site (slope, orientation, altitude as difference
	between reference, and sloped sites). This approach presents two
	advantages if compared with previously proposed models: Not only
	computation steps are greatly simplified but also error sources due
	to the simulation of climatic variables in sloped sites and the ET
	estimation are well distinguished. This model was validated at hourly
	and daily scales at four sites cultivated with wheat and oats offering
	a wide range of slope and orientation values: a reference site on
	plane, site 1 (9{\textdegree} sloping, NW orientation, 7 m from the
	reference site in plane), site 2 (6{\textdegree}, SE, 12 m) and site
	3 (1{\textdegree}, SE, 18 m). At hourly scale, the new model performed
	well at all sites studied. The observed slope of the linear relationships
	between estimated and measured ET values ranged between 0.93 and
	1.03, with coefficients of determination, r 2, between 0.80 and 0.98.
	At daily scale, the slopes of the linear relationships between measured
	and estimated ET for the sites on plane and the sloped sites were
	practically the same (0.98{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.01);
	however, the coefficient of determination r 2 observed in the site
	on plane was clearly greater (0.98) than that observed in the sloped
	sites (0.83). The presented analysis does not show any significant
	systematic effect of topography (slope and orientation of the plots)
	on the good performance of the proposed model for the ET estimation.
	Furthermore, we observed that coefficients of determination tend
	to decrease with the increase in the slope of the site, which translates
	into increased inaccuracy of the climatic variables simulation, in
	particular the net radiation, as the slope of the site increases.
	The proposed model allows to verify the different steps for calculating
	the fluxes, to identify the eventual sources of error and to make
	the needed corrections. For this reasons, the proposed model seems
	to be particularly ``operational'', i.e. a useful tool for estimating
	fluxes on hilly terrains.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In complex, sloping terrain, horizontal measurements of net
	radiation are not reflective of the radiative energy available for
	the conductive and convective heat exchange of the underlying surface.
	Using data from a grassland site on a mountain slope characterised
	by spatial heterogeneity in inclination and aspect, we tested the
	hypothesis that a correction of the horizontal net radiation measurements
	which accounts for the individual footprint contributions of the
	various surfaces to the measured sensible and latent heat eddy covariance
	fluxes will yield more realistic slope-parallel net radiation estimates
	compared to a correction based on the average inclination and aspect
	of the footprint. Our main result is that both approaches led to
	clear, but very similar improvements in the phase between available
	energy and the sum of the latent and sensible heat fluxes. As a consequence
	the variance in the sum of latent and sensible heat flux explained
	by available radiation improved by &gt;10%, while energy balance
	closure improved only slightly. This is shown to be mainly due to
	the average inclination and aspect corresponding largely with the
	inclination and aspect of the main flux source area in combination
	with a limited sensitivity of the slope correction to small angular
	differences in, particularly, inclination and aspect. We conclude
	with a discussion of limitations of the present approach and future
	research directions. },

  abstract  = { AbstractScaleX is a collaborative measurement campaign, collocated with a long-term environmental observatory of the German Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO) network in the mountainous terrain of the Bavarian Prealps, Germany. The aims of both TERENO and ScaleX include the measurement and modeling of land surface鈥揳tmosphere interactions of energy, water, and greenhouse gases. ScaleX is motivated by the recognition that long-term intensive observational research over years or decades must be based on well-proven, mostly automated measurement systems, concentrated in a small number of locations. In contrast, short-term intensive campaigns offer the opportunity to assess spatial distributions and gradients by concentrated instrument deployments, and by mobile sensors (ground and/or airborne) to obtain transects and three-dimensional patterns of atmospheric, surface, or soil variables and processes. Moreover, intensive campaigns are ideal proving grounds for innovative instruments, methods, and techniques to measure quantities that cannot (yet) be automated or deployed over long time periods. ScaleX is distinctive in its design, which combines the benefits of a long-term environmental-monitoring approach (TERENO) with the versatility and innovative power of a series of intensive campaigns, to bridge across a wide span of spatial and temporal scales. This contribution presents the concept and first data products of ScaleX-2015, which occurred in June鈥揓uly 2015. The second installment of ScaleX took place in summer 2016 and periodic further ScaleX campaigns are planned throughout the lifetime of TERENO. This paper calls for collaboration in future ScaleX campaigns or to use our data in modelling studies. It is also an invitation to emulate the ScaleX concept at other long-term observatories. },

	Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes ({PILPS},
	phase 2c) are used to investigate the sensitivity of the ground heat
	flux to the vegetation cover fraction and leaf area index ({LAI).}
	The two models are the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme ({BATS)}
	and the model developed at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics,
	Chinese Academy of Sciences ({IAP94).} The impacts of including transmission
	of solar radiation through the canopy in the {BATS} model are also
	assessed. The ground heat flux is the energy residual of net radiation
	minus latent plus sensible heat fluxes at the soil surface (also
	referred to as the soil heat flux). However, the energy residual
	above the canopy was used as a surrogate for the ground heat flux
	by the two models in the {PILPS} 2c study. The two energy residuals
	(i.e., above the canopy and at the soil surface) can differ depending
	on the modeled time step, the order in which the canopy and soil
	temperatures are computed, and whether canopy heat storage is included
	or neglected. As expected, reducing the areal coverage of vegetation
	results in an increased daytime soil heat flux, and increasing {LAI}
	leads to decreased soil heat flux and greater above-canopy latent
	heat flux. Both models show a strong sensitivity to {LAI} when {LAI}
	is small and little sensitivity when {LAI} is large. Allowing transmission
	of solar radiation through the canopy in {BATS} reduces the sensible
	heat flux above the canopy and enhances all the flux terms at the
	soil surface, especially when {LAI} is low. This model behavior is
	similar to that from {IAP94}, which uses a two-stream radiation scheme.
	This modification to {BATS} also results in a soil heat flux that
	lies within estimated bounds for a wide range of {LAI} (0.5-5.5).},

  abstract  = {The estimation of carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere
	suffers unavoidable data gaps in eddy-covariance technique, especially
	for short-living and fast-growing croplands. In this study we developed
	a modified gap-filling scheme introducing a leaf area index factor
	as the vegetation status information based on the conventional light
	response function for two East-Asian cropland sites (rice and potatoes).
	This scheme's performance is comparable to the conventional time
	window scheme, but has the advantage when the gaps are large compared
	to the total length of the time series. To investigate how the time
	binning approach performs for fast-growing croplands, we tested different
	widths of the time window, showing that a four-day window for the
	potato field and an eight-day time window for the rice field perform
	the best. The insufficiency of the conventional temperature binning
	approach was explained as well as the influence of vapor pressure
	deficit. We found that vapor pressure deficit plays a minor role
	in both the potato and the rice fields under Asian monsoon weather
	conditions with the exception of the early pre-monsoon growing stage
	of the potatoes. Consequently, we recommend using the conventional
	time-window scheme together with our new leaf-light response function
	to fill data gaps of net ecosystem exchange in fast-growing croplands.},

  abstract = {Abstract Oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus L.) is an important feedstock for biodiesel; hence, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and particularly fertilizer-derived nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during cultivation must be quantified to assess putative greenhouse gas (GHG) savings, thus creating an urgent and increasing need for such data. Substrates of nitrification [ammonium (NH4)] and denitrification [nitrate (NO3)], the predominant N2O production pathways, were supplied separately and in combination to OSR in a UK field trial aiming to: (i) produce an accurate GHG budget of fertilizer application; (ii) characterize short- to medium-term variation in GHG fluxes; (iii) establish the processes driving N2O emission. Three treatments were applied twice, 1 week apart: ammonium nitrate fertilizer (NH4NO3, 69 kg-N ha−1) mimicking the farm management, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 34.4 kg-N ha−1) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 34.6 kg-N ha−1). We deployed SkyLine2D for the very first time, a novel automated chamber system to measure CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes at unprecedented high temporal and spatial resolution from OSR. During 3 weeks following the fertilizer application, CH4 fluxes were negligible, but all treatments were a net sink for CO2 (ca. 100 g CO2 m−2). Cumulative N2O emissions (ca. 120 g CO2-eq m−2) from NH4NO3 were significantly greater (P < 0.04) than from NaNO3 (ca. 80 g CO2-eq m−2), but did not differ from NH4Cl (ca. 100 g CO2-eq m−2) and reduced the carbon sink of photosynthesis so that OSR was a net GHG source in the fertilizer treatment. Diurnal variation in N2O emissions, peaking in the afternoon, was more strongly associated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than temperature. This suggests that the supply of carbon (C) from photosynthate may have been the key driver of the observed diurnal pattern in N2O emission and thus should be considered in future process-based models of GHG emissions.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration is the largest C-flux component in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, yet in many biomes this flux and its environmental responses are still poorly understood. Several methodological techniques exist to measure this flux, but mostly there remain comparability uncertainties. For example, the closed static chamber (CSC) and the closed dynamic chamber (CDC) systems are widely used, but still require a rigorous comparison. A major issue with the CSC approach is the generally long manual gas sampling periods causing a potential underestimation of the calculated fluxes due to an asymptotic increase in headspace CO2 concentrations. However, shortening the sampling periods of the static chamber approach might provide comparable results to the closed dynamic chamber system. We compared these two different chamber systems using replicated CSC cover boxes and a Li-Cor 8100 CDC system under field conditions, and performed tests on both, mineral and peat soil. Whereas the automated CDC system calculated fluxes during the first two minutes, the CSC approach considered either all seven manual sampling points taken over 75 min, or only the first three sampling points over 15 min. Although flux variation was fairly large, there were considerable and statistically significant differences between the calculated fluxes considering the two chamber systems, yet this depended on soil type and the number of CSC sampling time points. The cover-box approach underestimated the chamber-based fluxes by 30{\%} for combined samples, 21{\%} for mineral and 39{\%} for peat soils when calculated over 75 min but was comparable over the first 15 min. The chamber flux comparison demonstrates that the CSC approach can provide CO2 flux measurements comparable to the CDC system when sampling at an appropriate initial frequency, preventing flux underestimation due to a build up of CO2 headspace concentrations.},

In the lower atmosphere, up to ~30\% of the primary OH radical production is attributed to the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO), and field observations suggest a large missing source of HONO. We show that soil nitrite can release HONO and explain the reported strength and diurnal variation of the missing source. Fertilized soils with low pH appear to be particularly strong sources of HONO and OH. Thus, agricultural activities and land-use changes may strongly influence the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. Due to the widespread occurrence of nitrite-producing microbes, the release of HONO from soil may also be important in natural environments, including forests and boreal regions.},

  abstract  = {Trace gases emitted either through the activity of microbial communities or from abiotic reactions in the soil influence atmospheric chemistry. In laboratory column experiments using several soil types, Oswald et al. (p. 1233) showed that soils from arid regions and farmlands can produce substantial quantities of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HONO). Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are the primary source of HONO at comparable levels to NO, thus serving as an important source of reactive nitrogen to the atmosphere.Abiotic release of nitrous acid (HONO) in equilibrium with soil nitrite (NO2{\textendash}) was suggested as an important contributor to the missing source of atmospheric HONO and hydroxyl radicals (OH). The role of total soil-derived HONO in the biogeochemical and atmospheric nitrogen cycles, however, has remained unknown. In laboratory experiments, we found that for nonacidic soils from arid and arable areas, reactive nitrogen emitted as HONO is comparable with emissions of nitric oxide (NO). We show that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria can directly release HONO in quantities larger than expected from the acid-base and Henry{\textquoteright}s law equilibria of the aqueous phase in soil. This component of the nitrogen cycle constitutes an additional loss term for fixed nitrogen in soils and a source for reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere.},
